 * <p>This enumeration defines all database types that the application can connect to and work with.
 * Each constant represents a specific database vendor and is used throughout the application for:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Database connection configuration and management</li>
 *   <li>Dialect selection for Hibernate ORM mapping</li>
 *   <li>Database-specific query optimization and feature detection</li>
 *   <li>Migration script selection and execution</li>
 *   <li>Database vendor-specific behavior customization</li>

 *
 * <p>The enum supports both enterprise-grade databases (Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL)
 * and lightweight databases (SQLite, H2, HSQLDB) suitable for development, testing,
 * and embedded applications.</p>
 *
 * <p>Usage example:</p>
 * <pre>
 * DatabaseType dbType = DatabaseType.POSTGRES_SQL;
 * String dialect = getHibernateDialect(dbType);
